                    <h3 class="headline__grid__container__item">Cook / Chef</h3>
                    <p>While working as a chef, I acquired many skills and experiences that I consider very useful in my
                        future job as a programmer. Here are some of these skills and experiences: <br>

                        <strong class=experience__title>Organization and time management:</strong> In the restaurant
                        kitchen, I had to be very
                        organized and able to effectively manage time to prepare dishes according to orders. This skill
                        will be very helpful in my future job as a programmer, especially when it comes to project
                        planning, setting priorities, and managing time efficiently.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Precision and accuracy:</strong> When preparing dishes, I had to
                        be precise and accurate
                        in measurements, mixing ingredients, and controlling cooking time. Now, in programming,
                        precision will be equally important, especially when writing code, testing, and troubleshooting.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Problem-solving:</strong> In the restaurant, I often had to
                        react quickly to
                        unpredictable situations, such as errors in dishes or issues with ingredient deliveries. Now, in
                        my future job as a programmer, I will also need to solve problems, identify code errors, and
                        develop complex technical solutions.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Creativity: </strong> In the kitchen, I often had to be creative
                        in experimenting with
                        new flavors, ingredient combinations, and dish decorations. Now, in programming, creativity will
                        be important when designing new features, optimizing code, and creating innovative solutions.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Teamwork:</strong> In the restaurant, I frequently worked in a
                        team, collaborating with
                        others to ensure a smooth flow of dish production. Now, in my future job as a programmer, I will
                        also work in project teams where collaboration will be crucial for achieving project goals.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Working under pressure:</strong> The restaurant kitchen was a
                        place of intense work
                        under pressure, especially during peak hours. This helped me develop the ability to work under
                        pressure, which will be very useful in my future job as a programmer, especially during
                        challenging project deadlines or technical issues.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Understanding the production process:</strong> Working as a chef
                        allowed me to
                        understand the production and processing process, which will be beneficial when working on
                        projects related to data processing or software production.
                        <br> <br>
                        While my work as a chef and the job of a programmer are different fields, many of the skills and
                        qualities I gained while working in the kitchen can be transferred and utilized in my future
                        role as a programmer. I am flexible and open to learning, which will allow me to leverage these
                        experiences in the future.

                    <p> Working as a mechanic, I have gained a range of skills and experiences that I consider valuable
                        in my future role as a programmer. Here are some of these skills and experiences:
                        <br> <br> <strong class=experience__title></strong>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Technical Troubleshooting:</strong> In my work as a mechanic, I
                        often
                        encounter diverse problems related to machinery that require logical thinking and
                        problem-solving. This skill will also be important in my future role as a programmer, where
                        I will be analyzing and fixing code errors.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Understanding of Technology and Systems:</strong> Through
                        working with various types of machines and equipment, I have gained a deeper understanding of
                        their operation and the interaction between different components. This understanding will be
                        similar to analyzing and understanding IT systems in programming.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Logical Thinking and Analysis</strong>: In my role as a
                        mechanic, I needed to analyze how different elements work together and what causes
                        malfunctions.
                        In programming, logical thinking will be crucial for creating efficient and effective code.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Planning and Organizational Skills:</strong> Repairing and
                        maintaining machines requires precise planning to ensure tasks are carried out efficiently
                        and
                        safely. The same applies to project management in programming, where planning project stages
                        is
                        crucial.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Creative Problem-Solving Approach:</strong>Creative
                        Problem-Solving Approach: Sometimes, as a mechanic, I needed to be creative in finding
                        solutions
                        for unconventional malfunctions or issues. The same will apply in programming, where
                        creative
                        thinking is necessary to develop innovative solutions.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Teamwork:</strong> In the mechanic's workshop, we often work
                        in
                        teams, especially on larger projects or complex repairs. The ability to collaborate with
                        others
                        will also be extremely important in my future role as a programmer, where I will often work
                        in
                        project teams.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Accuracy and Precision:</strong> In the role of a mechanic,
                        even
                        the smallest mistake can have significant consequences. This level of accuracy and precision
                        will also be important in programming to avoid code errors.
                        <br> <br>
                        In summary, my work as a mechanic is developing skills that will be very valuable in my
                        future
                        role as a programmer, particularly in problem-solving, technical analysis, logical thinking,

                        precise technique is essential to achieve the intended therapeutic effect. In programming,
                        accuracy is equally important, especially when writing precise and effective code.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Problem Solving and Adaptation:</strong> In my role as a massage
                        therapist, situations may arise that require quick adaptation and finding alternative solutions.
                        In programming, the ability to solve problems quickly is crucial.
                        <br> <br>
                        <strong class=experience__title>Independent Work and Self-Discipline:</strong> Running my own
                        business requires self-discipline, time management, and self-management skills. These skills are
                        equally important in programming, especially if I'm working independently or on freelancing
                        projects.
                        <br> <br>
